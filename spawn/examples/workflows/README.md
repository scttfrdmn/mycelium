- Built for microservices

## Quick Start

Each example directory contains:
- Working code/configuration
- README with setup instructions
- Sample input files
- Expected output description

## General Pattern

All examples follow this pattern:

1. **Launch**: Start sweep with `--detach --output-id`
2. **Wait**: Poll status with `--check-complete`
3. **Process**: Handle results based on exit code

## Prerequisites

- spawn installed and configured
- AWS credentials configured
- Tool-specific requirements (see individual READMEs)

## Testing Examples

```bash
# Test Airflow example
cd airflow && ./test.sh

# Test Prefect example
cd prefect && python spawn_flow.py

# Test with Docker
cd argo && kubectl apply -f workflows/spawn-sweep.yaml
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use --detach** for Lambda orchestration
2. **Capture IDs with --output-id** for tracking
3. **Check exit codes** for proper error handling
4. **Set timeouts** to prevent hanging
5. **Log everything** for debugging
