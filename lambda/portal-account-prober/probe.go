// probe.go — turning AWS API outcomes into accountlifecycle.ProbeResults.

// The whole point of this file is that classification is separable from calling
// AWS. The state machine's refusals are only as good as the inputs it is handed:
// mislabel one AccessDenied and a healthy account is deprovisioned, no matter how
// carefully ApplyProbes guards its transitions. So the classification lives here,
// behind interfaces, and is unit-tested without a cloud.
