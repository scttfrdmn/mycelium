// The terminal surface picks a target, and what it offers to pick from is the point.
//
// What shipped was a text field validated by /^i-[0-9a-f]{8,}$/. That has a usability
// failure and a blast-radius failure, and they pull in the same direction:
//
//   - An instance id is not something a person has. Getting one meant leaving for the
//     Instances page and copying one, so a surface that never read ctx.level was
//     effectively expert-only without saying so.
//   - The regex is a SYNTAX check. It accepts any instance id in the account,
//     including instances the portal never launched.
//
// The IAM fix (scoping ssm:StartSession to spawn:managed=true) is the actual authz
// boundary and lives in infra/tofu + the CFN template; these tests cover the browser
// half — that the default set of targets is the spawn-managed set, and that the
// surface never claims to know something it doesn't.
//
// The load-bearing assertions are the negative and the failure ones: that the list is
// populated from the provider rather than free text, that an empty list and a failed
// lookup say DIFFERENT things, and that a guided user is never left with a dead end.
