# Assets Directory

This directory contains visual assets for the Mycelium project.

## Required Logo Files

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED:** Please save the logo images to this directory.

The following files need to be added:

1. **`logo-light.png`** - Logo for light mode (GitHub light theme)
2. **`logo-dark.png`** - Logo for dark mode (GitHub dark theme)

### Where to Get the Logos

The logo images were provided with three glowing mushrooms representing:
- 🔍 **Truffle** (left mushroom) - Find and discover
- 🚀 **Spawn** (center mushroom) - Launch instances
- 🤖 **Spored** (right mushroom) - Monitor and manage

All connected by an underground mycelium network.

### File Specifications

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Dimensions**: Minimum 2000px wide (recommended)
- **Aspect Ratio**: ~16:5 (wide panoramic)
- **File Size**: Optimize/compress before committing

### Saving Instructions

1. Save the light mode logo as: `/Users/scttfrdmn/src/mycelium/assets/logo-light.png`
2. Save the dark mode logo as: `/Users/scttfrdmn/src/mycelium/assets/logo-dark.png`
3. Commit both files to git

## Current Status

The following READMEs have been updated to reference the logos:
- ✅ Main README (`/README.md`)
- ✅ Spawn README (`/spawn/README.md`)
- ✅ Truffle README (`/truffle/README.md`)

Once the logo files are saved, the logos will automatically appear on GitHub with adaptive theme support (light/dark mode).

## Testing

After saving the logos, verify they work by:

1. Viewing the repository on GitHub
2. Toggling between light and dark themes (Settings → Appearance)
3. Confirming the correct logo displays for each theme
