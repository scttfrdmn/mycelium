#
# This exists because of a specific failure, not as a style preference. PR #521
# (a CI-runner fix) was branched from a working tree that still held PR #519's
# portal commit, so #521's head contained BOTH changes. #521 merged first and
# carried the portal fix with it; #519 then merged as an EMPTY commit (131f02b).
#
# The damage wasn't cosmetic. deploy-site.yaml and web-ci.yml are path-filtered on
# `web/**`, so an empty merge commit matched neither: the PR whose entire purpose
# was fixing two user-facing strings produced no Web CI run and no site deploy,
# and it took a bundle-level audit of what was actually being served to establish
# whether the fix was live at all.
#
# Both symptoms — the empty commit and the swept-in unrelated files — come from
# one root cause: branching off a dirty HEAD instead of off origin/main. That is
# mechanically detectable, which is what this script does.
#
# Usage:  scripts/branch-preflight.sh          # check the current branch
#         scripts/branch-preflight.sh --fix    # print the commands to fix it
