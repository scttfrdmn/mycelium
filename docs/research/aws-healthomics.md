# AWS HealthOmics Research & Analysis

**Research Date:** 2026-01-27
**Issue:** #75
**Prepared For:** spawn/mycelium project evaluation

---

## Executive Summary

AWS HealthOmics is a **fully managed, HIPAA-eligible service** for genomics and bioinformatics workflows, announced by AWS and replacing the deprecated Amazon Genomics CLI. It provides three integrated components: **Workflows** (execution), **Storage** (data management), and **Analytics** (querying).

**Key Finding:** HealthOmics and spawn serve **complementary use cases** with minimal overlap. HealthOmics is optimized for genomics-specific workflows with managed infrastructure, while spawn provides flexible, general-purpose compute orchestration with user control.

**Recommendation:** **Monitor and document** HealthOmics as a specialized alternative for genomics workloads, but **do not integrate**. spawn's value proposition remains strong for users needing flexibility, cost control, and non-genomics workflows.

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: **MONITOR, DO NOT INTEGRATE**

**Rationale:**
1. **Minimal overlap:** HealthOmics targets managed genomics, spawn targets flexible HPC
2. **Complementary positioning:** HealthOmics for production, spawn for research/dev
3. **Integration complexity:** HealthOmics API integration adds minimal value
4. **spawn's unique value intact:** Cost, flexibility, and control remain key differentiators

### Secondary Actions

**1. Document HealthOmics as Alternative**
- Add section to spawn documentation: "When to Use AWS HealthOmics Instead"
- Position spawn as **development/research** tool, HealthOmics as **production/clinical**
- Highlight cost comparison (7x difference)

**2. Target Distinct User Segments**
- **spawn:** Academic labs, bioinformatics core facilities, method developers
- **HealthOmics:** Clinical labs, pharma, agriculture companies, HIPAA/CLIA environments

**3. Maintain Cost Efficiency Advantage**
- Continue optimizing spot instance usage (spawn's killer feature)
- Emphasize workflow engine flexibility (Snakemake, custom Python)
- Highlight transparent pricing (no hidden managed fees)

**4. Future Reassessment Triggers**
- IF HealthOmics adds Snakemake support → Re-evaluate integration
- IF HealthOmics allows BYO compute → Consider hybrid architecture
- IF HealthOmics pricing drops 50%+ → Reassess cost advantage
- IF spawn adds compliance features → Compete more directly

### Do NOT Build

❌ **spawn → HealthOmics API integration** - Low value, high complexity
❌ **Sequence Store compatibility** - Proprietary format, vendor lock-in
❌ **HealthOmics workflow converter** - Limited audience, niche use case

---

## Conclusion

AWS HealthOmics is a **powerful, specialized service** for genomics pipelines that require managed infrastructure, compliance-ready audit trails, and population-scale analytics. However, it comes at a **significant cost premium** (3-7x) and **limited flexibility** (WDL/Nextflow/CWL only, no Snakemake).

**spawn's value proposition remains strong:**
- **7x lower compute costs** (spot instances + ephemeral compute)
- **Universal workflow support** (any engine, any workload)
- **Full infrastructure control** (instance types, networking, regions)
- **Zero vendor lock-in** (standard AWS services)
- **Transparent, predictable pricing**

**Recommended Strategy:** Position spawn as the **cost-effective, flexible alternative** for research and development, while acknowledging HealthOmics as the **managed, compliance-ready solution** for production clinical/diagnostic use cases. The two services are **complementary, not competitive**.
