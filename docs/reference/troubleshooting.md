# Troubleshooting & common mistakes

Most spore.host surprises come from a handful of pairs that look interchangeable
but aren't. Each entry below is a mistake, why it happens, and the fix.

## `truffle find` vs `truffle search`

**Mistake:** expecting `--min-vcpu`/`--min-memory` to work on `find`, or expecting
`find` and `search` to be synonyms.

- **`find`** is *natural-language discovery* — put specs **in the query string**:
  `truffle find "epyc genoa 16 cores"`. It does **not** accept `--min-vcpu` etc.
- **`search`** is *exact filtering* over a pattern — flags work here:
  `truffle search "m8a.*" --min-vcpu 16 --min-memory 64`.

Use `find` when you know what you need in human terms; use `search` when you know
the exact technical filters. See [Truffle](/tools/truffle).

## Region vs Availability Zone

**Mistake:** treating a region and an AZ as the same scope. Capacity, and some
launches (Capacity Blocks), are **AZ-specific**. A type available in `us-east-1`
generally may still be unplaceable in `us-east-1a`. Use `truffle az` to inspect
per-AZ offerings and pass `--az` when placement must be pinned.

## Quota vs actual capacity

**Mistake:** assuming that because `truffle quotas` shows headroom, AWS will place
the instance. Quota is *permission* to launch; capacity is *availability right
now*. They're independent — you can be within quota and still get
`InsufficientInstanceCapacity`. That's exactly the gap [Lagotto](/tools/lagotto)
fills. See [Waiting for scarce capacity](/guides/waiting-for-capacity).

## stop vs hibernate vs terminate

| Action | Compute billing | EBS kept | RAM preserved | Reversible |
|--------|-----------------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **stop** | stops | yes | no | `spawn start` |
| **hibernate** | stops | yes | yes (restored on start) | `spawn start` |
| **terminate** | stops | **no** — volume destroyed | no | no |

**Mistake:** `terminate` to "pause" a job — it destroys the EBS volume and its
data. Use `stop`/`hibernate` to pause; `terminate` only when you're done.

## TTL vs idle timeout

**Mistake:** thinking either one alone will save you. **TTL** is the absolute,
non-resettable deadline (the hard guarantee). **Idle timeout** is a soft early
stop that any activity resets, and it never *terminates* — only stops/hibernates.
You typically want both. See [Costs & safety guarantees](/safety).

## Spot interruption vs idle shutdown

**Mistake:** conflating the two. A **Spot interruption** is AWS reclaiming the
instance (a 2-minute notice, outside your control); **idle shutdown** is spored
stopping an instance *you* left inactive. Different triggers, different handling —
set a `pre-stop` hook to save work for both.

## Restarting a stopped instance whose TTL already passed

**Mistake:** stopping an instance to "bank" its remaining time. The TTL is an
*absolute* deadline — if it elapsed while the instance was stopped, starting it
again will terminate it shortly after. Run `spawn extend` **before** starting if
you need more time.

## A command finishing vs the completion sentinel appearing

**Mistake:** expecting `on-complete` to fire because your script exited. spored
acts on the **completion sentinel** (`/tmp/SPAWN_COMPLETE` or `spored complete`) —
*not* on your process exiting. Your job script must create it explicitly:

```sh
./run-job.sh && spored complete --status success
```

## Instance role vs your user credentials

**Mistake:** assuming a launched instance inherits your laptop's AWS permissions.
It doesn't — it uses its **instance profile** (IAM role). If spored can't manage
the instance (e.g. call `ec2:TerminateInstances` on itself) or your job can't
reach S3, the instance profile is usually the missing piece. See
[IAM Permissions](/reference/iam-permissions).

## Local CLI vs remote spored timing

**Mistake:** expecting a tag or config change to take effect instantly. Some
actions are immediate API calls from spawn; others (idle, TTL, completion) are
enforced by **spored, which re-reads the instance's tags about once a minute**. A
`spawn instance-config` change can take up to a minute to be observed on the
instance. Use `spored reload` on the instance to force an immediate re-read.
