# Quick Start

Once your AWS access **and the required permissions** are in place, your first
protected instance takes about five minutes to launch. The permissions are the
one part that isn't automatic — so start by figuring out which situation you're in.

## First: which AWS account are you using?

::: tip Personal or admin-managed account
You can create IAM roles yourself, so you can install the required policy and go.
Follow this page top to bottom.
:::

::: warning Institution-managed account (most university / company accounts)
You can probably authenticate and launch some EC2, but you likely **cannot create
IAM roles or attach policies** — spawn needs both (once) for the spored instance
profile. You'll need your cloud/security administrator to apply the policy. Send
them the **[deployment packet](/reference/deployment-packet)** (the exact
least-privilege policy, what spawn creates, what it audits, and how to remove it),
then come back and continue from [Authenticate](#authenticate-with-aws).
:::

Not sure whether you have the permissions? After installing, run
[`spawn doctor`](#preflight-spawn-doctor) — it tells you exactly what's missing.

## Install

::: code-group

```sh [macOS / Linux (Homebrew)]
brew install spore-host/tap/truffle
brew install spore-host/tap/spawn
```

```powershell [Windows (Scoop)]
scoop bucket add spore-host https://github.com/spore-host/scoop-bucket
scoop install truffle spawn
```

```sh [Manual]
# Download the latest release assets for your OS/arch, then extract onto PATH.
# Assets are named like spawn_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz with lowercase
# GOOS/GOARCH (darwin|linux, amd64|arm64), so normalize uname's output first.
OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
case "$(uname -m)" in
  x86_64|amd64) ARCH=amd64 ;;
  arm64|aarch64) ARCH=arm64 ;;
  *) echo "unsupported arch: $(uname -m)" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac
for tool in spawn truffle; do
  url=$(curl -fsSL "https://api.github.com/repos/spore-host/${tool}/releases/latest" \
    | grep -o "https://[^\"]*_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz" | head -1)
  curl -fsSL "$url" -o "${tool}.tar.gz"
  tar -xzf "${tool}.tar.gz" "$tool"
  sudo install "$tool" /usr/local/bin/
done
```

:::

Verify the installation:

```sh
truffle --version
spawn --version
```

## Authenticate with AWS

spore.host uses whatever AWS credentials your shell already has. The recommended way to get them is **`aws login`** (AWS CLI v2.32.0+), which signs you in and refreshes short-lived credentials automatically:

```sh
aws login                       # sign in (opens your browser)
aws sts get-caller-identity     # confirm you're authenticated
```

Other paths work too — pick whichever matches your organization:
- **IAM Identity Center (SSO):** `aws configure sso` then `aws sso login --profile <name>` (set `AWS_PROFILE` or `--profile`).
- **Static keys / CI / assumed roles:** any credential your shell already resolves (env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`, instance role) is used as-is.

`aws login` is preferred where available because the credentials are short-lived.

Your credentials need permission to launch and manage EC2 instances; see the [recommended least-privilege baseline](/reference/iam-permissions). For the full picture — profiles, `SPORE_*` config, and how your auth relates to what spore.host does on your behalf — see [AWS Authentication](/guides/aws-auth).

## Preflight: `spawn doctor`

Before launching anything, confirm your environment is actually ready:

```sh
spawn doctor
```

It runs read-only checks — credentials, the resolved account and region, the EC2
and IAM permissions spawn needs, a usable VPC/subnet, an SSH key, Session Manager —
and reports **✓ / ⚠ / ✗** for each. It launches nothing.

- **All ✓ (or only ⚠):** you're ready — continue below.
- **Any ✗ on an IAM/permission check:** that's the permissions cliff. On a personal
  account, apply the [IAM baseline](/reference/iam-permissions). On an
  institution-managed account, send your admin the
  [deployment packet](/reference/deployment-packet) — the failing checks are
  exactly what they need to grant.

If `spawn doctor` passes, the rest of this Quick Start should work as written.

## Find an instance

Before launching, use `truffle` to find what's available and compare prices:

```sh
# Find a small instance in your region
truffle find "t3 medium"

# Find GPU instances with Spot prices
truffle find "nvidia gpu" --regions us-east-1
```

You'll see a table of matching instance types with vCPUs, memory, GPU specs, on-demand price, and current Spot price. Pick a type that fits your workload and budget.

## Launch your first instance

The simplest launch uses the interactive wizard. Just run `spawn` with no arguments:

```sh
spawn
```

The wizard walks you through instance type, region, SSH key, and TTL (the duration after which the instance automatically terminates). It takes about two minutes.

For a non-interactive launch:

```sh
spawn launch \
  --name my-first-instance \
  --instance-type t3.medium \
  --ttl 4h
```

Once running, you'll see the instance ID, hostname, and how to connect:

```
✓ Instance i-0a1b2c3d4e5f running
✓ my-first-instance.abc123.spore.host
✓ Connect: spawn connect my-first-instance
✓ Auto-terminates in 4h
```

## Connect

```sh
spawn connect my-first-instance
```

`spawn connect` is the canonical way in — it resolves the instance, uses the
right key, and logs you in as **your own username** (spawn creates a Linux user
matching your local login and imports your existing public key —
`~/.ssh/id_ed25519` or `~/.ssh/id_rsa` — generating a managed key only if you have
neither). Raw `ssh <you>@<public-ip>` works too, but prefer `spawn connect` so you
don't have to track the address, key, or username yourself.

## Check status

```sh
spawn list
spawn status my-first-instance
```

## Extend the TTL

If you need more time before the instance terminates:

```sh
spawn extend my-first-instance 8h
```

## Clean up

When you're done, **terminate** — this deletes the instance and its EBS volume,
so nothing keeps billing:

```sh
spawn terminate my-first-instance
```

Prefer to pause and resume later? **Stop** instead — but note a stopped instance
still bills for its EBS storage until you terminate it:

```sh
spawn stop my-first-instance       # resumable with `spawn start`; EBS still bills
```

(You didn't have to remember this: the `--ttl` you set means the instance
self-terminates at its deadline regardless.)
