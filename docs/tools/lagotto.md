# Lagotto <span class="doc-badge advanced">Advanced</span> <span class="doc-badge stable">Stable</span>

**What it is.** Lagotto watches for EC2 instance capacity and acts when it appears.
It runs as a serverless Lambda in **your own account** — no always-on server.

**When to use it.** When the type you want is within quota but has no capacity
*right now* (scarce GPU families like `p5.48xlarge`), or when you need a launch to
fire at a future clock time (e.g. into a Capacity Block). Answers the question
truffle and a one-shot spawn can't: *"should I keep checking until it's placeable?"*

**First commands:**

```sh
lagotto deploy                                   # stand up the watcher (once)
lagotto watch "p5.48xlarge" --regions us-east-1,us-west-2 --action notify --ttl 7d
lagotto list                                     # see active watches
lagotto status <watch-id>
```

New to it? Walk through [Waiting for scarce capacity](/guides/waiting-for-capacity).

There is no AWS API that reports "capacity is available right now" — the only true test is an actual launch. So for `spawn` watches **the launch attempt is the capacity test**: Lagotto tries to launch, and if AWS returns `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` it simply keeps the watch active and tries again on the next poll. It does the tedious retrying for you instead of you sitting there re-running a launch by hand, until it succeeds or the watch's TTL expires.

## Install

```sh
brew install spore-host/tap/lagotto
```

## The problem it solves

Some instance types — particularly high-demand GPU families like p5.48xlarge or trn1.32xlarge — have intermittent availability. You want the instance, but there's none available right now. Without Lagotto, your options are: keep trying manually, or write your own polling loop.

Lagotto automates the waiting.

## Core commands

### `lagotto watch`

Create a watch for an instance type pattern in one or more regions:

```sh
# Watch for any p5 instance and notify when available
lagotto watch "p5.*" --ttl 7d

# Limit to specific regions
lagotto watch "p5.48xlarge" --regions us-east-1,us-west-2

# Watch and notify via email or webhook
lagotto watch "p5.48xlarge" --action notify \
  --notify email:you@example.com

# Watch and auto-launch when capacity appears
lagotto watch "g5.xlarge" --action spawn \
  --spawn-config my-job.yaml

# Watch for Spot capacity under a price ceiling
lagotto watch "p4d.24xlarge" --spot --max-price 10.00

# Watch for SageMaker ml.* capacity and submit your training job when it appears
lagotto watch "ml.g5.2xlarge" --service sagemaker \
  --sagemaker-config train-job.json \
  --notify email:you@example.com

# …or only be notified, and submit the job yourself
lagotto watch "ml.g5.2xlarge" --service sagemaker --action notify \
  --notify email:you@example.com
```

#### Watching SageMaker capacity (`--service sagemaker`)

SageMaker Training/Processing jobs can fail with `CapacityError` even when your
quota is sufficient. AWS exposes **no** read-only SageMaker capacity API, so
`--service sagemaker` watches the **correlated EC2 family as a proxy**
(`ml.g5.2xlarge` → `g5.2xlarge`). EC2 `g5` availability is a *hint* that
SageMaker `ml.g5` capacity is likely available — but SageMaker is a separate
managed pool, so it is not a guarantee.

When the proxy fires, lagotto can **submit your SageMaker job for you**: pass the
job definition with `--sagemaker-config <file.json>` (the `CreateTrainingJobInput`
document, validated server-side at submit). lagotto submits it, then polls the
job — a `Completed`/running job records a match, a `CapacityError` leaves the
watch active to retry on the next cycle. This makes a capacity-blocked SageMaker
job fire-and-forget.

If you'd rather submit the job yourself, use `--action notify` (no
`--sagemaker-config`): the notification tells you it's worth retrying, and the
watch keeps running so you're alerted again if the job still hits `CapacityError`.
`--action hold` is rejected for SageMaker — there is no capacity-reservation
equivalent.

### `lagotto list`

```sh
lagotto list              # active watches only
lagotto list --all        # include matched, failed, expired, and cancelled
lagotto list --output json
```

### `lagotto status`

```sh
lagotto status <watch-id>
```

### `lagotto cancel`

```sh
lagotto cancel <watch-id>
```

### `lagotto extend`

```sh
lagotto extend <watch-id> --ttl 48h
```

### `lagotto history`

```sh
lagotto history                        # all your matches
lagotto history --watch-id <watch-id>  # one watch
```

### `lagotto poll`

Manually trigger one polling cycle (useful for testing), or loop in the foreground with `--daemon`:

```sh
lagotto poll                                 # one cycle
lagotto poll --daemon --interval 5m          # loop, infra-free (no Lambda needed)
```

In a **shared account**, scope a daemon to your own watches so it doesn't drive another project's:

```sh
lagotto poll --daemon --project fieldwork    # only that project (or $LAGOTTO_PROJECT)
lagotto poll --daemon --mine                 # only watches you created
lagotto poll --daemon --watch w-aaa,w-bbb    # only these watch IDs
```

A scoped daemon exits when **its** watches drain. Before acting on a match a poller claims a short **lease** on the watch, so two daemons — or a daemon racing the hosted Lambda — can't both launch it (`--no-lease` opts out). Tag a watch for scoping with `lagotto watch --project NAME` (or `$LAGOTTO_PROJECT`).

### `lagotto launch`

Schedule a launch by **time** rather than capacity — fire once at a clock time (`--at`), after a delay (`--after`), or on a recurring cron (`--cron`):

```sh
# Launch into a Capacity Block at its reserved start time
lagotto launch --at 2026-07-01T08:00:00Z --az us-east-1a --spawn-config block.yaml

# Launch 6 hours from now
lagotto launch --after 6h --spawn-config job.yaml

# Recurring: every weekday at 09:00 UTC
lagotto launch --cron "0 9 ? * MON-FRI *" --spawn-config nightly.yaml
```

The motivating case is launching into an **EC2 Capacity Block for ML** at its reserved start time — see [Capacity Blocks](#capacity-blocks-for-ml) below. Scheduled launches run on EventBridge Scheduler in the hosted poller stack, so they require `lagotto deploy` first; the launched instance always carries a TTL. If an instance with the same `Name` tag already exists at fire time, `--if-exists skip|launch|replace` decides what happens (default: `skip` for one-shots so a Capacity Block can't double-book, `launch` for cron).

## Actions

When a watch matches, Lagotto can:

| Action | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| `notify` | Sends a notification via `--notify` channels (email, webhook, SNS) |
| `spawn` | Launches an instance using the config file given in `--spawn-config` |
| `hold` | Creates a short-lived On-Demand Capacity Reservation to hold the capacity |

SageMaker watches (`--service sagemaker`) support `notify` (alert only) or `spawn`
— for SageMaker, `spawn` **submits your training job** via
`--sagemaker-config` rather than launching an EC2 instance. `hold` is not
supported (no capacity-reservation equivalent).

## Watch lifecycle

A watch is `active` while it's being polled, and ends in one of:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `matched` | The action succeeded (notified, launched, or held) |
| `failed` | A launch hit a **terminal** error that retrying can't fix (bad AMI/IAM, exhausted quota) |
| `expired` | The watch TTL elapsed before it could act |
| `cancelled` | You cancelled it with `lagotto cancel` |

The watch **TTL is the only time limit** — there is no max-retry count. A
capacity failure (`InsufficientInstanceCapacity`) is *not* terminal: the watch
stays `active` and retries on the next poll until it launches or the TTL runs out.

## How it works

Lagotto deploys as an AWS Lambda function with an EventBridge schedule trigger.
Each tick (default 5 minutes) it pre-filters with `DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings`
and spot pricing to decide which watches are worth acting on — but those are only
hints, not capacity guarantees. For a `spawn` watch the actual launch is the real
test: a capacity failure keeps the watch active to retry, while a terminal failure
marks it `failed`.

The poller is a **self-terminating, per-account singleton**: there is one Lambda
+ schedule per account, every invocation sweeps all active watches, and watches
drop out of the active set as they launch, fail, or expire. When **zero** active
watches remain, the Lambda disables its own schedule — no watches, no Lambda.
Creating a new watch re-arms it.

## Capacity Blocks for ML

Lagotto is the last step of the end-to-end Capacity Block flow across the three tools:

1. **Discover** a purchasable offering — `truffle capacity-blocks --instance-type p5.48xlarge --count 1 --duration-hours 24` (read-only).
2. **Purchase** it — `spawn capacity-block purchase <offering-id> ...` (billed up front, non-refundable; three typed confirmations, interactive-only).
3. **Launch into it at the reserved start time** — `lagotto launch --at <block-start> --az <block-az> --spawn-config block.yaml`, where `block.yaml` sets `reservation_id` + `capacity_block: true` (forwarded to `spawn launch --reservation-id … --capacity-block`).

Step 3 is why `lagotto launch --at` exists: the block becomes usable at its start time, and a scheduled launch brings the instance up automatically — no one awake at 08:00 to run it.

## Deploy

Deploy the hosted poller stack **into your own account** with one command:

```sh
lagotto deploy                 # stand up Lambda + EventBridge + DynamoDB + IAM
lagotto deploy --teardown      # remove it
```

`lagotto deploy` downloads the published poller Lambda artifact, uploads it to a bucket in your account, and deploys the embedded CloudFormation template. The poller schedule deploys disabled and the first `lagotto watch` arms it; the stack self-tears-down when no watches or pending scheduled launches remain. See the [deployment guide](https://github.com/spore-host/spore-host/blob/main/lagotto/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the manual CloudFormation path and details. Once deployed, the `lagotto` CLI manages watches and scheduled launches in that infrastructure.
