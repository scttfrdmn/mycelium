# Common Workflows

You usually arrive with a goal, not a tool in mind. Start with the story closest to
what you're trying to do — each is a complete, end-to-end walkthrough — then branch
into the deeper guides. New to spore.host? Do [Your first
instance](/guides/first-instance) first; it's the 15-minute backbone the stories
below build on.

## Story A — Interactive research workstation

*"I need a big machine for a few hours to explore some data, then it should go
away."*

```sh
truffle find "amd genoa 64gb" --region us-east-1     # 1. find a fit
spawn launch analysis \                              # 2. launch with guards
  --instance-type m8a.4xlarge \
  --ttl 8h \
  --idle-timeout 30m
spawn connect analysis                               # 3. work on it
spawn terminate analysis                             # 4. done — tear it down
```

- **`--ttl 8h`** is the hard deadline — the instance terminates then no matter
  what, so a forgotten session can't run all weekend.
- **`--idle-timeout 30m`** stops it early if you wander off; any activity resets
  the timer. Idle *stops*, TTL *terminates* — see [Costs & safety
  guarantees](/safety).
- **Cost:** capped at 8 × the hourly rate; usually far less because idle stops it.
  Check the rate with `truffle spot m8a.4xlarge` before you launch.

## Story B — Unattended batch computation

*"Run this script on a big box; when it finishes, terminate — I'm not watching."*

```sh
spawn launch simulation \
  --instance-type c8a.12xlarge \
  --ttl 12h \
  --command "./run-model.sh && spored complete --status success" \
  --on-complete terminate
```

What happens in each case:

- **Succeeds** → the `&&` reaches `spored complete`, the completion sentinel
  appears, and `--on-complete terminate` tears the instance down.
- **Fails** → `run-model.sh` exits non-zero, `spored complete` never runs, so the
  instance stays up (for you to debug) until the **TTL** terminates it at 12h.
- **Hangs** → idle detection won't fire (a running process is activity), but the
  **TTL** still terminates at 12h. TTL is the backstop that always wins.

The distinction that trips people up: it's the **completion sentinel appearing**
that triggers `on-complete`, not your command merely exiting — which is why the
script calls `spored complete` explicitly. See
[Troubleshooting](/reference/troubleshooting#a-command-finishing-vs-the-completion-sentinel-appearing).

sweeps](/guides/parameter-sweeps) · [Batch queues](/guides/batch-queue)

## Story C — Scarce GPU capacity

*"I need a p5.48xlarge, but there's never one available when I try."*

1. **[Truffle](/tools/truffle)** confirms the type exists and you have quota.
2. **[Spawn](/tools/spawn)** tries to launch — and gets
   `InsufficientInstanceCapacity`.
3. **[Lagotto](/tools/lagotto)** watches three regions every five minutes.
4. A notification arrives the moment capacity appears.
5. Lagotto launches it automatically with a 6-hour TTL — no one awake required.

This is the one workflow the "find → launch" path can't do alone, because *quota*
and *capacity* are different things. Full walkthrough: [Waiting for scarce
capacity](/guides/waiting-for-capacity).
