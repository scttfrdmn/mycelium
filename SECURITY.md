# Security Overview for spore.host

**Audience:** CISOs, Cloud Administrators, Security Engineers

**Purpose:** Security assessment and operational guidance for deploying spore.host tools in AWS environments.

> **The name is spore.host, but spore.host is not the host.** It never holds your
> AWS credentials and never runs your compute. Everything runs in **your own AWS
> account** with **your own credentials**. For the full trust/data-flow map, see
> [Security, credentials & data flow](docs/architecture.md).

---

## Executive Summary

**spore.host** is a suite of command-line tools (plus one in-instance agent) for
AWS EC2 instance discovery and ephemeral, self-terminating compute. Its
components:

- **truffle** — EC2 instance-type / price / quota search (read-only).
- **spawn** — EC2 instance launcher and lifecycle manager (read/write).
- **spored** — the in-instance agent spawn installs on every instance; enforces
  TTL, idle, completion, and cost rules from *inside* the instance.
- **lagotto** — capacity watcher that waits for scarce instance types and launches
  when they appear.
- **spore-bot** — optional chat control (Slack/Teams) via a hosted Lambda.
- **MCP server** — exposes a read-mostly subset of operations to AI assistants
  (search, status, stop, terminate, extend — **no launch**).
- **plugin registry** ([spore-plugins](https://github.com/spore-host/spore-plugins)) —
  optional post-launch software installers; official plugins are **cosign-signed**
  and verified by spawn before install (see §4).

**Security Model:** your credentials never leave your machine; least-privilege
IAM; explicit resource tagging; in-instance lifecycle enforcement with an
out-of-band backstop; automatic cleanup of ephemeral resources.

**Risk Profile:** Medium — requires EC2 launch permissions and one-time IAM role
creation for the spored instance profile.

**Compliance:** spore.host does not centrally receive or store workload data.
Supports CloudTrail auditing and resource tagging; compliance obligations remain
with the user's AWS environment, configuration, and controls (see §5).

## 1. Architecture Overview

### truffle (Read-Only Tool)

**Purpose:** Search and compare EC2 instance types across regions

**AWS Services Used:**
- EC2 DescribeInstanceTypes (read-only)
- EC2 DescribeRegions (read-only)
- EC2 DescribeAvailabilityZones (read-only)

**Security Posture:** Zero write permissions, no resource creation

**Data Access:** Only AWS service metadata (pricing, specifications)

**Risk Assessment:** **LOW** - Cannot modify infrastructure

---

### spawn (Instance Launcher)

**Purpose:** Launch ephemeral EC2 instances with automatic termination

**AWS Services Used:**
- **EC2:** Launch, terminate, and query instances
- **IAM:** Create service role for spored agent (once per account)
- **SSM Parameter Store:** Query latest Amazon Linux AMI IDs
- **S3:** Download spored agent binary (public read, SHA256-verified)

**Security Posture:** Requires EC2 launch permissions and limited IAM role creation

**Resource Lifecycle:** Automatic cleanup via TTL and idle detection

**Risk Assessment:** **MEDIUM** - Can launch instances (cost implications)

---

## 2. IAM Permissions Required

### For truffle (Read-Only)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes",
        "ec2:DescribeRegions",
        "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Compatible with:** ReadOnlyAccess, ViewOnlyAccess, PowerUserAccess

---

### For spawn (Minimum Required)

See `spawn/IAM_PERMISSIONS.md` for complete policy.

**Summary:**
- **EC2:** Launch, terminate, describe instances (standard compute access)
- **IAM:** Create `spored-instance-role` and `spored-instance-profile` (one-time setup)
- **SSM:** Read `/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/*` (AMI auto-detection)

**Compatible with:** PowerUserAccess + spawn-specific IAM permissions (see below)

**NOT Compatible with:** PowerUserAccess alone (missing IAM permissions)

---

### PowerUser + spawn IAM Policy

For organizations using AWS `PowerUser` managed policy, add this supplementary policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "SpawnIAMRoleManagement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:GetRole",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy",
        "iam:CreateInstanceProfile",
        "iam:GetInstanceProfile",
        "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile",
        "iam:PassRole"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/spored-instance-role",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:instance-profile/spored-instance-profile"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "SpawnIAMTagging",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:TagRole",
        "iam:TagInstanceProfile"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:iam::*:role/spored-instance-role",
        "arn:aws:iam::*:instance-profile/spored-instance-profile"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why:** PowerUser excludes all IAM permissions. This grants minimal IAM access scoped to spawn-specific resources only.

---

## 3. IAM Role Created by spawn

### spored-instance-role

**Purpose:** Allows spored agent (running on EC2 instances) to self-manage based on tags

**Trust Policy:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Permissions Policy:**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeTags",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:TerminateInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "ec2:ResourceTag/spawn:managed": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security Controls:**
- ✅ Can only terminate/stop instances tagged `spawn:managed=true`
- ✅ Cannot terminate instances launched by other tools
- ✅ Cannot modify IAM policies
- ✅ Cannot access S3, databases, or other AWS services
- ✅ Scoped to EC2 instance lifecycle only

---

## 4. Security Features

### Automatic Resource Cleanup

**TTL (Time-To-Live):**
- User specifies maximum instance lifetime (e.g., `--ttl 8h`)
- spored agent monitors uptime
- Terminates instance when TTL expires
- **Benefit:** Prevents forgotten instances running indefinitely

**Idle Detection:**
- User specifies idle timeout (e.g., `--idle-timeout 30m`)
- spored monitors SSH sessions and CPU utilization
- Terminates or hibernates when idle threshold reached
- **Benefit:** Reduces cost for intermittent workloads

**Laptop Independence:**
- spored runs as systemd service on the instance (not laptop)
- Auto-termination works even if laptop is off or disconnected
- **Benefit:** Prevents orphaned resources from VPN disconnections

---

### Resource Tagging

All instances launched by spawn are tagged:

```
spawn:managed = true
spawn:root = true
spawn:created-by = spawn
spawn:version = <spawn version that launched it>
spawn:ttl = <duration>           (if specified)
spawn:idle-timeout = <duration>  (if specified)
```

**Benefits:**
- Cost allocation and chargeback
- Automated cleanup policies (AWS Config, Lambda)
- Compliance reporting (which instances have TTL?)
- Security auditing (CloudTrail queries by tag)

---

### Binary Distribution Security

**How spored reaches an instance:** at boot, the instance's user-data downloads
the spored binary and a `.sha256` checksum from a public, regional S3 bucket
(`spawn-binaries-<region>`), verifies the checksum, then installs and runs it.

**What the SHA-256 check does — and does not — provide:**

- ✅ **Corruption detection.** It catches an incomplete or corrupted download
  (truncated transfer, storage bit-rot). If the bytes don't match, the install
  fails and the instance does not run a damaged binary.
- ❌ **It does NOT authenticate the publisher.** The checksum is served from the
  **same bucket** (same trust domain) as the binary. An attacker who could modify
  the binary in the bucket could also replace the `.sha256` — the check would then
  pass. A same-origin checksum guards against accidental corruption, **not**
  against compromise of the artifact-publishing account or bucket. HTTPS protects
  the transport, not the origin.

**This is a known limitation with signing in progress.** Publisher
authentication for spored binaries is tracked at
[spore-host#440](https://github.com/spore-host/spore-host/issues/440): the target
design signs each spored binary with a spore.host-held key, publishes the
signature alongside the binary, and has the bootstrap verify that signature
against a public key **compiled into spawn** (whose own release is independently
trusted via Homebrew / GitHub Releases) — moving the trust root out of the S3
bucket. Until that ships, treat the S3 SHA-256 as an integrity (not authenticity)
control and rely on the S3 bucket policy + account controls below to limit who can
write to the bucket.

> **Note — this is distinct from plugin signing, which *is* shipped.** Official
> **plugins** in the registry are cryptographically signed with cosign/sigstore
> (keyless, via a GitHub Actions OIDC identity) and their signature is verified by
> spawn before install (§4, *Plugin supply chain*). That covers plugin manifests,
> not the spored/spawn release binaries, which are the subject of #440 above.

**S3 Bucket Policy (public read, restricted write):**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadSporedBinaries",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::spawn-binaries-*/spored-*"
    }
  ]
}
```
Write access to the bucket is restricted to the release pipeline; public access
is read-only for the binary objects.

---

### Plugin supply chain

Optional plugins (post-launch software installers) are resolved and, for official
plugins, cryptographically verified before anything runs:

- Official plugin releases are **cosign-signed keyless** in CI (a GitHub Actions
  OIDC identity → Fulcio certificate + Rekor transparency-log entry).
- `spawn` verifies the signature by default for an official versioned reference,
  pinning the signing identity to the spore-plugins release workflow. A missing or
  invalid signature is a hard failure (`--insecure` bypasses it for local dev).
- Each plugin also ships a checksum manifest verified against the fetched
  `plugin.yaml`, and a plugin's declared `permissions:` block is enforced against
  its steps at publish time.

This closes the "who authored this code that runs on my instance" question for
plugins. See the [registry supply-chain design](https://github.com/spore-host/spore-plugins).

---

### SSH Key Management

**Fingerprint-Based Key Reuse:**
- spawn calculates MD5 fingerprint of local SSH public key
- Searches AWS EC2 for existing key pair with matching fingerprint
- Reuses existing key if found (no duplicate uploads)
- Only uploads if no matching key exists

**Benefits:**
- No duplicate keys cluttering AWS account
- Consistent key usage across multiple launches
- User can pre-import keys with custom names

**Security:**
- Only public keys handled (private keys never leave laptop)
- Keys stored in AWS EC2 KeyPairs (standard AWS service)
- No custom key storage or management

---

## 5. Audit and Compliance

### CloudTrail Events

All spawn operations generate CloudTrail events:

**IAM Role Creation:**
```
CreateRole (spored-instance-role)
PutRolePolicy (spored-policy)
CreateInstanceProfile (spored-instance-profile)
AddRoleToInstanceProfile
```

**Instance Launch:**
```
RunInstances
  - Tags: spawn:managed=true, spawn:ttl=8h
  - IamInstanceProfile: spored-instance-profile
  - UserData: <base64-encoded script>
```

**Instance Termination (by spored):**
```
TerminateInstances
  - InitiatedBy: spored (via instance profile role)
  - Reason: TTL expired / idle timeout
```

**Query Examples:**

Find all spawn-launched instances:
```bash
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=ResourceType,AttributeValue=AWS::EC2::Instance \
  --query 'Events[?contains(CloudTrailEvent, `spawn:managed`)]'
```

Find instances terminated by spored:
```bash
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=TerminateInstances \
  --query 'Events[?contains(CloudTrailEvent, `spored-instance-role`)]'
```

---

### Cost Control

**Built-In Mechanisms:**
1. **TTL Enforcement:** Hard limit on instance runtime
2. **Idle Detection:** Automatic termination of unused instances
3. **Resource Tagging:** Cost allocation via `spawn:*` tags
4. **Spot Instance Support:** `--spot` flag for 70% savings

**Recommended Controls:**
1. **AWS Budgets:** Alert on `spawn:managed=true` tag spend
2. **Service Control Policies:** Limit instance types per OU
3. **IAM Conditions:** Require `--ttl` flag via policy conditions
4. **Cost Anomaly Detection:** Alert on unusual spawn usage patterns

**Example Budget:**
```bash
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id 123456789012 \
  --budget file://spawn-budget.json
```

```json
{
  "BudgetName": "spawn-instances-monthly",
  "BudgetLimit": {
    "Amount": "1000",
    "Unit": "USD"
  },
  "TimeUnit": "MONTHLY",
  "BudgetType": "COST",
  "CostFilters": {
    "TagKeyValue": ["user:spawn:managed$true"]
  }
}
```

---

### Compliance Considerations

**The key fact:** spore.host does **not** centrally receive, process, or store
your workload data. Instances run in your VPC, under your account, with your
credentials; any data on them is placed there by you. spore.host therefore cannot
confer compliance — compliance obligations remain with your AWS environment, the
services you enable, your configuration, your data handling, and your
institutional controls. Do not assume a workload is compliant merely because the
instance runs in your own VPC.

What spore.host *does* provide that supports a compliance program:

**GDPR / Data Residency:**
- spawn respects the region you choose (`--region`); no cross-region movement of
  your data by spore.host.

**PCI-DSS / HIPAA:**
- No workload data flows to spore.host; instances run in your VPC under your
  network controls. EBS encryption is supported. Meeting these frameworks depends
  on *your* configuration and BAAs/controls, not on spore.host.

**SOC 2 / ISO 27001:**
- CloudTrail captures all spawn operations; resource tagging supports inventory;
  automatic cleanup reduces standing surface area. These are inputs to your
  controls, not attestations by spore.host.

---

### Lifecycle guarantee by deployment mode

The TTL guarantee ("every protected instance has a hard termination deadline") is
enforced in two layers: **spored** inside the instance, and an optional
**out-of-band reaper** that acts as a backstop if spored can't. What you get
depends on which you deploy:

| Mode | spored (in-instance) | Out-of-band reaper | Workload data leaves account | Failure guarantee |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **CLI only** (default) | Yes | No | No | Instance-local enforcement: spored terminates at TTL. If spored itself is disabled/killed, only your AWS-side controls (Budgets/SCPs) remain. |
| **Self-hosted backstop** | Yes | Yes (in your account) | No | Dual enforcement: the reaper terminates past-deadline instances even if spored fails. |
| **Hosted integrations** | Yes | Yes / optional | Selected metadata only (never credentials or workload data) | Dual enforcement when the reaper is enabled. |

Notes on the reaper (see
[spawn/lambda/ttl-reaper](https://github.com/spore-host/spawn/tree/main/lambda/ttl-reaper)):

- It is **not enabled by default** and ships in **dry-run** (logs "would reap" +
  notifies; does not terminate) until an operator flips it to enforce mode after
  verification.
- It assumes a **narrow per-account cross-account role you grant** (scoped to
  terminating past-deadline `spawn:managed` instances) — it never holds your
  credentials.
- With **no reaper configured**, the hard guarantee is provided by spored alone;
  the reaper is the backstop for the case where spored can't act. Verify spored is
  running and the deadline is set with `spawn status`.

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Excessive instance launches | Medium | AWS Budgets, SCPs, `--ttl` requirement |
| IAM role privilege escalation | Low | Role scoped to `spawn:managed=true` only |
| spored binary corruption | Low | SHA256 verification, HTTPS |
| spored binary tampering (bucket compromise) | Medium | S3 bucket write-access controls today; publisher signing in progress (#440) — same-bucket SHA256 does **not** mitigate this |
| Forgotten instances | Low | TTL enforcement, idle detection |
| Insider threat (malicious user) | Medium | CloudTrail auditing, IAM least privilege |
| Credential exposure | Medium | No credentials in user-data, IMDSv2 supported |

### Mitigations Summary

✅ **Least Privilege IAM:** Users only get permissions they need
✅ **Resource Tagging:** All resources identifiable and auditable
✅ **Automatic Cleanup:** TTL/idle detection prevents resource leaks
✅ **Audit Trail:** CloudTrail captures all operations
✅ **Cost Controls:** Budgets, SCPs, Spot instances
✅ **Binary Integrity (corruption):** SHA256 verification of spored downloads
✅ **Plugin Authenticity:** official plugins cosign-signed + verified by spawn
⏳ **spored Binary Authenticity:** publisher signing in progress (#440); today's same-bucket SHA256 detects corruption, not compromise
✅ **Network Security:** User controls VPC, security groups, subnets

## 7. Deployment Recommendations

### For Small Teams (< 50 users)

1. **IAM Users with spawn policy** (see `IAM_PERMISSIONS.md`)
2. **AWS Budget alert** at $500/month
3. **CloudTrail enabled** (standard AWS best practice)
4. **Require `--ttl` via documentation** (not enforced)

### For Enterprises (> 50 users)

1. **IAM Groups:**
   - `spawn-power-users`: Full spawn access
   - `spawn-basic-users`: spawn + instance type restrictions via SCP

2. **Service Control Policies:**
   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Deny",
     "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
     "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
     "Condition": {
       "StringNotLike": {
         "ec2:InstanceType": [
           "t3.*",
           "t4g.*",
           "m7i.large",
           "m7i.xlarge"
         ]
       },
       "StringEquals": {
         "aws:PrincipalTag/spawn-user": "true"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Mandatory TTL via IAM Policy:**
   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Deny",
     "Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
     "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
     "Condition": {
       "StringNotEquals": {
         "aws:RequestTag/spawn:ttl": "*"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   *(Note: Requires spawn to always set TTL tag)*

4. **Cost Allocation Tags:**
   - Enable `spawn:*` tags as cost allocation tags
   - Monthly reports by team/project

5. **Security Hub Integration:**
   - Custom AWS Config rule: "Instances must have `spawn:ttl` tag"
   - Alert on non-compliant spawn instances

---

## 8. Incident Response

### Scenario: Unauthorized Instance Launch

**Detection:**
```bash
# Find all spawn instances
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --filters "Name=tag:spawn:managed,Values=true" \
  --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].[InstanceId,LaunchTime,State.Name]'

# Check CloudTrail for who launched
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=ResourceType,AttributeValue=AWS::EC2::Instance
```

**Response:**
1. Identify user via CloudTrail `userIdentity`
2. Terminate instance: `aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-xxxxx`
3. Review user IAM permissions
4. Check AWS Budget impact

---

### Scenario: spored Role Privilege Escalation Attempt

**Detection:** CloudWatch Logs Insights query:

```
fields @timestamp, errorCode, errorMessage
| filter eventSource = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
| filter userIdentity.principalId like /spored-instance-role/
| filter errorCode like /Unauthorized/
```

**Response:**
1. Identify instance: Extract instance ID from CloudTrail
2. Terminate instance immediately
3. Review spored role policy (should be read-only except for self-termination)
4. Check for IAM policy modifications

---

## 9. Validation and Testing

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run `./scripts/validate-permissions.sh <aws-profile>` for each user
- [ ] Create test AWS Budget for spawn resources
- [ ] Enable CloudTrail in all regions
- [ ] Test IAM role creation (first spawn launch)
- [ ] Verify TTL enforcement (launch instance with `--ttl 5m`)
- [ ] Verify idle detection (launch instance with `--idle-timeout 10m`)
- [ ] Test Spot instances (`--spot` flag)
- [ ] Review CloudTrail events for spawn operations

### Security Testing

```bash
# Test 1: Verify spored cannot terminate non-spawn instances
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxx --instance-type t3.micro
# (manually launched, no spawn:managed tag)
# spored should fail to terminate this

# Test 2: Verify TTL enforcement
echo '[{"instance_type":"t3.micro","region":"us-east-1"}]' | \
  spawn launch --ttl 5m
# Wait 6 minutes, verify instance terminated

# Test 3: Verify SHA256 verification
# Corrupt spored binary on S3, verify instance launch fails

# Test 4: Verify CloudTrail logging
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=RunInstances
```

## 10. Code-Level Security Hardening

### Command Injection Protection

spawn implements comprehensive protection against shell command injection attacks:

**Security Package** (`spawn/pkg/security`):
- `ShellEscape()`: Properly escapes strings for POSIX shell arguments
- `ValidateUsername()`: Validates usernames against safe patterns
- `ValidateCommand()`: Detects potentially dangerous shell characters

**Protected Operations**:
1. **SSH Commands** (`spawn/cmd/config.go`):
   - Config keys and values properly escaped before SSH execution
   - Prevents injection via `spawn config set "key" "value; rm -rf /"`

2. **User Data Scripts** (`spawn/cmd/launch.go`):
   - Usernames validated against regex: `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}$`
   - SSH keys validated as proper base64
   - All dynamic values shell-escaped in bash scripts

3. **MPI Templates** (`spawn/pkg/userdata/mpi.go`):
   - Custom `shellEscape` template function
   - MPI commands properly escaped: `{{.MPICommand | shellEscape}}`

4. **Storage Mounting** (`spawn/pkg/userdata/storage.go`):
   - Mount paths validated and escaped
   - Filesystem DNS names escaped in mount commands

**Test Coverage**: security-critical paths are covered by unit tests with
attack-pattern fuzzing; current coverage is reported by CI on each repo.

---

### Path Traversal Protection

All file path operations are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks:

**Validation Functions**:
- `ValidatePathForReading()`: Blocks `../../etc/passwd` style attacks
- `ValidateMountPath()`: Restricts mounts to `/mnt`, `/data`, `/scratch`
- `SanitizePath()`: Removes traversal sequences for safe logging

**Blocked Paths**:
- `/etc/` - System configuration
- `/sys/` - System kernel interface
- `/proc/` - Process information
- `/root/` - Root home directory
- `/boot/` - Boot loader files
- `/dev/` - Device files
- `/var/lib/` - System libraries

**Protected Operations**:
1. **User Data File Reads** (`spawn/cmd/launch.go`):
   - Both `--user-data-file` and `--user-data @file` validated
   - Prevents reading system files

2. **Job Result Uploads** (`spawn/pkg/agent/queue_runner.go`):
   - Glob patterns validated before expansion
   - Prevents uploading sensitive files

---

### Credential Protection

Sensitive credentials are protected from exposure:

**Security Functions**:
- `MaskSecret()`: Masks secrets showing only first/last 4 chars
- `MaskURL()`: Shows scheme and domain, masks path
- `SanitizeForLog()`: Removes AWS keys from log messages
- `EncryptSecret()`/`DecryptSecret()`: KMS-based encryption (ready for use)

**Use Cases**:
- Webhook URLs in alert configurations
- API tokens in logs
- AWS access keys accidentally logged

---

### Audit Logging Infrastructure

Structured audit logging for security-sensitive operations:

**Audit Package** (`spawn/pkg/audit`):

**AuditLogger** - Structured JSON logging:
```go
logger := audit.NewLogger(os.Stderr, userID, correlationID)
logger.LogOperation("terminate_instances", sweepID, "success", nil)
```

**Context Propagation**:
```go
ctx = audit.NewContextWithAudit(ctx, userID)
logger := audit.NewLoggerFromContext(ctx)
```

**Audit Event Fields**:
- `timestamp`: UTC timestamp
- `level`: info/error
- `operation`: Action performed
- `user_id`: AWS account/user ID
- `instance_id`: Resource identifier
- `region`: AWS region
- `correlation_id`: Trace requests across systems
- `result`: success/failed/initiated
- `error`: Error message if failed
- `additional_data`: Structured metadata

**Ready for CloudWatch Logs Integration**:
- JSON format for CloudWatch Logs Insights
- Correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- User attribution for compliance

**Test Coverage**: audit paths are unit-tested; current coverage is reported by CI.

---

### Security Testing

**Test Suites**:
1. **Attack Pattern Tests** (`pkg/security/shell_test.go`):
   - Command injection: `; rm -rf /`, `$(whoami)`, backticks
   - Path traversal: `../../etc/passwd`
   - Variable expansion: `${IFS}malicious`

2. **Path Validation Tests** (`pkg/security/path_test.go`):
   - System directory blocking
   - Mount point restrictions
   - Traversal detection

3. **Audit Logger Tests** (`pkg/audit/logger_test.go`):
   - JSON formatting
   - Context propagation
   - Error logging

**Coverage Targets**: security and audit packages target ≥80% coverage, enforced
by a CI ratchet floor; current figures are shown by each repo's coverage badge.

## 11. Frequently Asked Questions (Security)

### Q: Can spawn access my existing EC2 instances?

**A:** No. spawn can only launch new instances and terminate instances tagged `spawn:managed=true`. It cannot access, modify, or terminate instances launched by other tools.

---

### Q: What data does spawn send to external services?

**A:** None. spawn only communicates with:
- AWS APIs (EC2, IAM, SSM)
- S3 buckets for spored binary download (public, read-only)

No telemetry, analytics, or user data leaves your AWS account.

### Q: Can spored access my S3 buckets or databases?

**A:** No. The `spored-instance-role` only has permissions for:
- Reading its own EC2 tags
- Terminating/stopping itself

It cannot access S3, RDS, DynamoDB, or any other AWS services.

---

### Q: What if someone modifies the spored binary on S3?

**A:** Be precise about the two cases. **Accidental corruption** (truncated
download, bit-rot) is caught: user-data verifies the SHA-256 before executing, and
a mismatch aborts installation. **Malicious replacement by an attacker who has
write access to the bucket** is *not* caught today, because the `.sha256` is served
from the same bucket — an attacker who can replace the binary can also replace its
checksum. That gap is mitigated by restricting bucket write access to the release
pipeline, and is being closed by publisher signing
([#440](https://github.com/spore-host/spore-host/issues/440)), which verifies a
signature against a key compiled into spawn rather than a checksum from the same
bucket. See §4, *Binary Distribution Security*.

### Q: Can users extend or bypass TTL limits?

**A:** Users can extend the TTL of a running instance with `spawn extend <name> <duration>`. This updates the EC2 tag and spored picks up the new deadline live. They cannot remove the TTL entirely once set.

They could also:
- Manually terminate the instance and launch a new one (new TTL starts)
- SSH in and stop the spored service (instance won't auto-terminate)

**Mitigation:** CloudWatch Events rule to detect spored service failures.

### Q: How do I audit spawn usage?

**A:** Use CloudTrail:

```bash
# All spawn launches (last 7 days)
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=ResourceType,AttributeValue=AWS::EC2::Instance \
  --max-results 1000 \
  --query 'Events[?contains(CloudTrailEvent, `spawn:managed`)].{Time:EventTime,User:Username,Instance:Resources[0].ResourceName}'

# Cost by user (requires Cost Allocation Tags)
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2025-12-01,End=2025-12-31 \
  --granularity MONTHLY \
  --group-by Type=TAG,Key=spawn:created-by \
  --metrics BlendedCost
```
