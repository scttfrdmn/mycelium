# docs-site — OpenTofu module (#404).
#
# Codifies the delivery layer for docs.spore.host, mirroring the dns-updater /
# spore-bot import-onto-live pattern. All of this was created imperatively
# (console/CLI); this module is `tofu import`ed onto the live resources and must
# `tofu plan` to a near-zero diff (only additive managedby tags) before it owns
# anything — see README.md.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: docs.spore.host went fully dark (503 on every request) because
# the CloudFront function `spore-host-docs-url-rewrite` had corrupt code (141
# bytes of binary garbage) so CloudFront couldn't run it. Nothing in the repo was
# the source of truth for that function, so a bad manual edit could — and did —
# take the whole docs site down with no reviewable history. This module makes the
# FUNCTION CODE source-controlled (url-rewrite.js) — that is the primary point.
#
# Deliberately NOT managed here (same discipline as the sibling modules):
#   - S3 OBJECT CONTENT: the built VitePress site is deployed by
#     .github/workflows/docs.yaml (`aws s3 sync docs/.vitepress/dist`). Tofu owns
#     the bucket's SHAPE (policy, public-access-block, OAC wiring) but never its
#     objects.
