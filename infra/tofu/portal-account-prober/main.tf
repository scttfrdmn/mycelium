# portal-account-prober — OpenTofu module (spawn#457 lifecycle wiring).
#
# The scheduled caller of accountlifecycle.ApplyProbes. Every run it scans the
# spore-portal-accounts registry, assumes each account's spore-portal-onboard role,
# counts spawn-managed instances across every region, and writes back only the
# lifecycle transitions the state machine decided. It exists so spore.host can
# eventually conclude "this account is gone" and expire the Route53 A-records that
# would otherwise outlive their instances and resolve to a stranger's IP.
#
# Runs in the INFRA account (966362334030), the control plane — same account as
# dns-updater / spore-bot / portal-phone-home. Fresh apply, not import-onto-live.
# Function CODE is managed out-of-band (Makefile upload); Tofu owns the shape.
#
# ── The security decision this module encodes ────────────────────────────────
#
# The prober needs sts:AssumeRole into every onboarded customer account. That is a
# genuinely powerful grant, and the whole point of putting it in a SEPARATE function
# is to keep it away from the two places it could have gone:
#
#   * portal-phone-home already holds the trust relationship — but it is
#     internet-facing under a Function URL. Adding assume-into-any-customer-account
#     there would place that capability one handler bug from the public edge.
#   * spawn's ttl-reaper already assumes into customer accounts every 10 minutes —
#     but a DIFFERENT role (spawn-ttl-reaper-ec2, from a manual CFN deploy, listed
#     in REAPER_ROLE_ARNS). It cannot assume the roles the registry knows about, so
#     pointing it at the registry would mean probing accounts it has no credentials
#     for and recording their unreachability as fact.
#
# This function has no URL, no public trigger, and one EventBridge schedule as its
# only invoker. Its assume-role grant is narrowed three ways below: to a single role
# NAME across all accounts, and (per statement Sid) to nothing else.
