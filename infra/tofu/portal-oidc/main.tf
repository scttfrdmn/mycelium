# portal-oidc — OpenTofu module (spore.host portal, Phase 3).
#
# The net-new AWS trust the default portal (spore-host/web) signs into. The
# browser federates an institutional identity through Globus Auth
# (CILogon/InCommon) and calls sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity directly — no
# backend, no long-lived keys. This module codifies the two pieces that makes
# possible, matching the trust proven live in spawn-ts's demo (demo/README.md):
#
#   1. an IAM OIDC identity provider for https://auth.globus.org
#   2. a role that trust-scopes AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity to
#        - aud == the portal's Globus client-ID   (the app users log into)
#        - sub == an allow-list of Globus identity UUIDs (who may launch)
#      and grants exactly the EC2 launch + iam:PassRole perms a spawn launch needs.
#
# UNLIKE the infra-account modules (dns-updater, spore-bot), this is a fresh
# `apply` into the DEV compute account (435415984226) — the account where the
# demo and the #38 cross-account launch were validated and where
# spored-instance-profile already exists — NOT an import-onto-live. There is no
# pre-existing resource to reconcile.
#
# Why sub-UUIDs and not email: AWS only exposes a generic OIDC provider's `aud`
# and `sub` as IAM condition keys — `email` is NOT a usable condition key here.
# So "only friedman@ucla.edu" is enforced by pinning `sub` to that person's
# stable Globus identity UUID (resolved via `globus get-identities`), exactly as
# the demo was tightened. Add more users by appending their UUIDs to
# allowed_globus_subs.

# demo). client_id_list carries the portal's aud PLUS any additional_client_ids
# (the demo's) so importing/managing it here never revokes another app's access.
# Modern AWS verifies the provider's TLS chain against its trust store, so the
# thumbprint isn't security-critical for well-known CAs; AWS reconciles it, and we
# ignore drift on it so a Globus cert rotation doesn't force a diff.
#
